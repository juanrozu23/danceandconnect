          </h3> <br>

        He was asked to capture in a one-minute film what is it that connects human beings. Juanma, the writer, director and producer of this film, immediately had a clear vision of the message he wanted to convey. Being located in New York University Abu Dhabi, the most diverse university, he had to display the vibrant energy his friends from all around the world bring in one activity that unites them all: dance. He has loved dance ever since he was a baby, and began lessons early on in his teenage years. He holds the strong belief that, through dance, people can get to deeply get to know each other and the magic that their upbringing has. Furthermore, he believes that the process of human connection is something uplifting and seamless. This is why the film has a very upbeat tone and beat. The #myNYUAD sign in the background is used as a visual cue for audiences not familiar with the location. <br>
        <br>

        By placing all dancers in different shots, with a mask on, and in the same location, Juan intended to explore how was human connection affeted by the pandemic. He intended to show, through tone of the video and music, that not even a global pandemic can stop humans from establishing connections. It can't stop us from dancing and sharing bautiful moments together.
